# RS

Hi Mitchell/Mo/Vailis,

I have provided two solutions, "Elegant solution" and "Thread group solution". 

To get them working you need to add the following files into  jmeter/bin/ directory 

- Dat_RS_Categories.dat
- RS.02.06.ThreadGroupMethod.jmx
- RS.02.06.ElegantMethod.jmx

Add the following plug in
-	Throughput shaping Timer
-	Jpgc standard set

and run them with Jmeter version 5.3.

The elegant one does not work fully but it give you an indication that l try for better solutions. The Thread group needs to be refined but its should be enough to show you l know jmeter.

I have uploaded them to GIT as requested https://github.com/rubbles81/RS.git but have also attached this email.
